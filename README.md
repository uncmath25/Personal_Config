# Configuration Files for Personal Setup

### Details:

Contained in this repo are configuration templates and notes that I will need when setting up a new computer.  I am a data scientist, but also take on plenty of web and general coding projects for fun, so this setup should be rather extensible to other developers. Note that "linux" here refers to Ubuntu distros - I use Linux Mint for personal use.  I have obviously removed any personal data from this repo :) Hopefully others might find these resources helpful.

### Components:
* Mac setup notes - *./mac_setup.md*
  * mardown describing in details the instructions I need to setup my preferred working environment
* Linux setup notes - *linux_setup_checklist.txt*
  * text file outlining the instruction I took for my last Linux Mint 19 Tonya install
* ssh - *./ssh/config_template*
  * template for how a ssh config file should be written
* nginx - *./nginx*
  * templates for how an nginx server config file could be set up for linux or mac
* nano - *./nano_config*
  * a couple nice configurations for python use
* Mac bash profile - *./mac_bash_profile*
  * preferred aliases and path additions
* Link mac configs = *./_mac_link_configs.sh*
  * installs the ssh, nano and bash profile configurations for mac for the current user
