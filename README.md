# Personal Setup Notes

### Details:

Contained in this repo are configuration templates and notes that I will need when setting up a new computer.  I am primarily a data scientist and engineer, but also take on plenty of web and general coding projects for fun: so this setup should be rather extensible to other developers. My Linux distro of choice is "Linux Mint".  I have obviously removed any personal data from this repo :) Hopefully others might find these resources helpful.

### Components:
* **_old** - Archived install notes from previous setups
* **aws** - Templates for standard aws cli creds
* **config** - Bash and nano config files for home directory (Note: append don't override to ~/.bashrc)
* **misc** - Miscellaneous notes
* **nginx** - Standard nginx config files alongs with restart scripts used with my personal vps alongside a mysql database
* **ssh** - Config file template with local port forwarding option
* **linux_mint_setup.md** - Setup process for Linux Mint 19.3 fresh install
* **mac_setup.md** - Setup process for Mac
